Ready For Warmer Temperatures? Here's Typically When the First 70s, 80s of Spring Arrive

A cold, wintry pattern has dominated the weather in areas east of the Rockies since the beginning of the year and has many asking: When does it typically warm up to really feel like spring?

To find the answer, we took a look at when, on average, selected cities across the U.S. see the first 70- or 80-degree day based on climatological averages. We also examined the earliest and latest these temperatures were reached.

Springlike warmth typically emerges in late March and early April, but some areas wait closer to May to regularly experience mild conditions.

It's important to note that different parts of the country think of and experience spring differently. Highs in the 60s are reminiscent of spring in the northern tier, but further south, many people still wear light jackets or sweaters until highs top out in the 70s. For some, spring even means temperatures closer to 80 degrees.

Northeast Waits Until April
The first 70-degree day happens by the end of March for most locations in the mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast. Areas closer to Washington D.C. reach that milestone in February. Parts of New England and upstate New York don't normally hit 70 degrees until April.

Most of the Northeast will wait until April to see temperatures in the 80s. However, temperatures climbed to the 80-degree mark last year on March 26 for New York City, Philadephia and Washington, DC. The latest initial 80-degree day has occurred in late May or June.

The first glimpse of spring has come as early as January for most cities in the Northeast. The earliest 70-degree temperatures recorded for much of the region are in early January. Late January into mid-February is when the first 60-degree temperature of the year is usually recorded here, although the average first high in the 60s isn't until April 7.
